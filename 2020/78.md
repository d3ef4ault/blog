## Talk about the development process

Originally, the first version was the WeChat applet version. At that time, the review was directly hit back, as if individuals could not publish the applet containing the user's system.

So from this, my program will become an app and will not be available in the domestic application market, so I can only suspend the development of the app by flutter

UWP was registered as a developer a few years ago, but no app was released at that time, and I am familiar with c # in my spare time, so I took this program as an experimental version.

The UWP version has ideas to be compatible with the obsolete Win10 Mobile, because there are still a few lumia phones on hand
